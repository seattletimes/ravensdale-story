1,slide1.gif,"Coal discovery","<p>Sometime during the early 1880s, prospectors from the Black Diamond Coal Mining Company, of Nortonville, Calif., discovered a series of large coal beds in southeast King County. Demand for coal was high, thanks to the voracious needs of nearby boomtowns like Seattle and Tacoma. Black Diamond quickly purchased land rights to the area and set the stage for years of future mining.</p>",1a.mp3
2,slide2.gif,"Railroad expansion","<p>Transportation of coal in King County was made possible by a rapidly expanding railroad line. Mining towns flourished along the route of this new railroad, populating a strip of land in Washington that would prove to be one of the richest coal seams in the state.</p>",2.mp3
3,slide3.gif,"The early days","<p>Construction of the Ravensdale mine began in 1899, in anticipation of the railroad’s arrival the following year. The mine would eventually operate 24 hours a day and draw miners from all over the U.S. and even Europe.</p>",3.mp3
4,slide4.gif,"Boomtown years","<p>By the time Ravensdale was incorporated in 1903, it had become a small boomtown, complete with a hotel, doctor’s office, barbershop and housing for single miners and up to 78 families.</p> <p>Ravensdale thrived for more than a decade. In its heyday, the town had more than 1,000 residents. Miners worked six days a week and earned $3 per day – the equivalent of about $70 today.</p>",4.mp3
5,slide5.gif,"Tragedy strikes","<p>On the drizzly afternoon of Nov. 16, 1915, the town’s worst nightmare came true: 1,500 feet below ground, a massive explosion tore through the mine, leaving 31 miners dead.</p>",5.mp3
6,slide6.gif,"Mine closure","<p>The town was forever changed. Operation of the coal mine halted immediately and the Northwest Improvement Company, which had purchased the mines, moved its equipment elsewhere.</p> <p>With the loss of the mining business, Ravensdale’s population dropped rapidly. By the 1920s, the number of residents had plummeted to less than a couple hundred. At this point, the town disincorporated – the only town in King County ever to do so.</p>",6.mp3
7,slide7.gif,"Ravensdale today","<p>A century later, freight trains still pass through town, and several old miners’ homes are still occupied.</p> <p>Few other traces of the old mining town remain, but its history isn’t forgotten. A series of 15 interpretive signs has been installed in Ravensdale Park. Largely a volunteer project, these signs serve as a reminder to visitors and locals alike of how this community came to be, and the sad reality of what happened there a century ago.</p>",7.mp3
