1,slide1.gif,"Coal discovery","In the early 1880s, prospectors from the Black Diamond Coal Mining Company of Nortonville, Calif. discovered a series of large coal beds in southeast King County. Demand for coal was high, thanks to the voracious needs of booming towns like Seattle and Tacoma. Black Diamond quickly purchased rights to the coal-rich area and set in motion plans for commercial exploitation of the land.",1.mp3
2,slide2.gif,"Railroad expansion","During this time, transportation of coal in King County was made possible by a rapidly expanding railroad line. Mining towns flourished along the route of the new railroad, populating a strip of land that would prove to be one of the richest coal seams in Washington state.",2.mp3

4,slide4.gif,"Boomtown years","By 1903, Ravensdale had become a small boomtown, complete with a hotel, company store, doctor’s office, barber shop, boarding house for single miners, and housing for up to 78 families. At its heyday, the town had over one thousand residents.",4.mp3
5,slide5.gif,"Tragedy strikes","Ravensdale thrived for more than a decade. Miners worked six days a week and earned $3 per day. But on November 16, 1915, a massive underground explosion shook the mine. Thirty-one miners were killed and the town was forever changed.",4.mp3
6,slide6.gif,"Mine closure","The accident was Ravensdale’s worst nightmare come true. Operation of the coal mine halted immediately. The Northwest Improvement Company, which had purchased the mines, moved their equipment elsewhere, never to return. With the loss of the mining business, Ravensdale’s population dropped rapidly. By the 1920s, the number of residents had plummeted to less than a couple hundred. At this point, the town disincorporated – the first and only town in King County ever to do so.",5.mp3
7,slide7.gif,"Ravensdale today","A century later, freight trains still pass through town, and several old miners’ homes are left standing, now occupied by current-day residents. Few other traces of the old mine town remain, but the history is not forgotten. The town has installed a series of interpretive signs in Ravensdale Park to remind visitors of the sad reality of what happened a century ago, 1,500 feet below the ground.",6.mp3
