1,slide1.gif,"Coal discovery","<p>Some time during the early 1880s, prospectors from the Black Diamond Coal Mining Company of Nortonville, Calif. discovered a series of large coal beds in southeast King County. Demand for coal was high, thanks to the voracious needs of boomtowns like Seattle and Tacoma. Black Diamond quickly purchased rights to the coal-rich area and set in motion plans for commercial exploitation of the land.</p>",1.mp3
2,slide2.gif,"Railroad expansion","<p>Transportation of coal in King County was made possible by a rapidly expanding railroad line. Mining towns flourished along the route of this new railroad, populating a strip of land in Washington that would prove to be one of the richest coal seams in the entire state.</p>",2.mp3
3,slide3.gif,"The early days","<p>Construction of the Ravensdale mine began in 1899, in anticipation of the railroad’s arrival the following year. The mine would eventually operate 24 hours a day and draw miners from all over the U.S. and even Europe in search of work.</p>",3.mp3
4,slide4.gif,"Boomtown years","<p>By 1903, Ravensdale had become a small boomtown, complete with a hotel, company store, doctor’s office, barbershop, boarding house for single miners, and housing for up to 78 families.</p> <p>Ravensdale thrived for more than a decade. At its heyday, the town had over one thousand residents. Miners worked six days a week and earned $3 per day, or the equivalent of about $70 today.</p>",4.mp3
5,slide5.gif,"Tragedy strikes","<p>But on the drizzly afternoon of November 16, 1915, the town’s worst nightmare came true: 1,500 feet below ground, a massive explosion tore through the mine, leaving 31 miners dead.</p>",4.mp3
6,slide6.gif,"Mine closure","<p>The town was forever changed. Operation of the coal mine halted immediately. The Northwest Improvement Company, which had purchased the mines, moved their equipment elsewhere, never to return.</p> <p>With the loss of the mining business, Ravensdale’s population dropped rapidly. By the 1920s, the number of residents had plummeted to less than a couple hundred. At this point, the town disincorporated – the first and only town in King County ever to do so.</p>",5.mp3
7,slide7.gif,"Ravensdale today","<p>A century later, freight trains still pass through town, and several old miners’ homes are left standing, now occupied by current-day residents.</p> <p>Few other traces of the old mine town remain, but the history is not forgotten. The town has installed a series of interpretive signs in Ravensdale Park to remind visitors of the sad reality of what happened there a century ago.</p>",6.mp3
